This repository contains [EDA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_design_automation)
source files describing, in part or whole, various electrical accessories or
setups for the Honda CTX1300AE motorcycle. The EDA files are in CadSoft Eagle 7
format and only the `.SCH` (schematic) is provided for obvious reasons. No
guarantee is made as to which minor version of Eagle was used to save the file,
but it *may* be the latest at the time of this writing.

All files included here are compatible with the free version of Eagle (i.e.
describe schematics having no more than one sheet).
